This is used to to determine if Minecraft Fabric mods (available on Modrinth) are available in different versions. To use it, download https://github.com/polarbear945/Mod-List-Generator/raw/refs/heads/main/mod_list_generator.bat, move the downloaded file the directory containing the mods folder, then run the batch file. This will download all required files and run the program. open_links.bat opens Modrinth pages for all mods. To uninstall this program and delete all files, run uninstall_generator.bat.

This only works for Fabric mods available on Modrinth and it is sometimes wrong.
